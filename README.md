#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is writing instructions? code that a computer can understand to create apps, games, websites, etc to solve real world problems

Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. It involves a structured and disciplined approach to building reliable, efficient, and scalable software solutions.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)

The NATO introduced the term "software engineering" to address the software crisis—a period when projects frequently ran over budget, were delayed, or failed entirely.


2. The Rise of Agile and DevOps (2001-Present)

In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was published, prioritizing iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability over rigid processes.
Faster, more reliable software releases, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and automation.

3. The AI and Low-Code/No-Code Revolution (2020s-Present)

The rise of AI-driven development (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT for coding) has accelerated software creation.
Low-code/no-code platforms enable non-developers to build applications with minimal coding knowledge.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning - define scope and objectives of the project
2. Define the requirements - Gather all documents and system requirements
3. Design- create system mockups, databases
4. Implementation - Code, test, then debug
5. Testing- identify and fix bugs
6. Deployment - Release the software to production (manual or automated deployment).
7. Maintenance & Support - Monitor performance, fix bugs, and release updates.
Implement enhancements and security patches.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Comparison of Waterfall and Agile Methodologies

Waterfall
Approach	Sequential, phase-by-phase	
Flexibility	Rigid; difficult to make changes mid-project	
Customer Involvement	Limited until the final product is delivered	
Testing	Performed at the end of development	
Project Scope	Defined upfront, minimal changes allowed	
Delivery	Delivered as a complete product at the end	Delivered in small, working increments
Best for	Large-scale, well-defined projects	


Agile
Iterative, continuous feedback loops
Highly adaptable to changing requirements
Continuous feedback and collaboration
Continuous testing throughout development
Evolves as the project progresses
Dynamic, fast-changing projects


When to Use Each Methodology

Waterfall is Best For:
Well-defined projects with clear requirements – e.g., Building an air traffic control system, where precision is crucial, and changes could be costly.
Regulatory & compliance-heavy industries – e.g., Developing medical software that must pass strict FDA approvals.
Fixed budgets and deadlines – e.g., A government contract for infrastructure software, where changes mid-project are difficult to accommodate.

Agile is Best For:
Startups and fast-changing environments – e.g., Developing a mobile app where user feedback constantly shapes features.
Projects with evolving requirements – e.g., Creating a custom e-commerce platform, where new trends may shift priorities.
Continuous deployment software – e.g., Cloud-based services like SaaS platforms, where new features and bug fixes roll out frequently.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developers: 

Develop the software following either the Agile or Waterfall method of the SDLC from start to Deployment

Quality Assurance Engineers: 

Ensure that the software performs as intended, that its free from bugs and that maintenance is done regularly to ensure efficiency and effectiveness 

Project Managers:

Coodinate activities of the SDLC, ensuring that tasks that need to be finished are indeed finished within the allocated timeframe so other ones can start at the stipulated start time 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Both IDEs and VCS are essential tools that enhance efficiency, collaboration, and code quality in software development.

IDE examples: Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, etc
VCS: GIT, GitHub, etc

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Managing Complex Codebases
Challenge: As projects grow, code becomes more complex, making it harder to maintain and debug.
Solution: Follow coding best practices like modular design, clean code principles, and proper documentation.

2. Keeping Up with Rapidly Changing Technology
Challenge: New programming languages, frameworks, and tools emerge constantly.
Solution: Allocate time for continuous learning (online courses, tech blogs, conferences).

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing
Tests individual components (functions, methods, or modules) in isolation.
Ensures that each unit of code works as expected.
Importance:
Catches bugs early in development.
Improves code maintainability and reliability.
Makes refactoring safer by verifying that changes don’t break functionality.

2. Integration Testing
Tests interactions between multiple components, modules, or external services.
Ensures that different parts of the system work together correctly.
Importance:
Detects issues in communication between components.
Ensures API endpoints work as expected.
Verifies data flow between modules.

3. System Testing
Tests the entire software system as a whole to verify that it meets functional and non-functional requirements.
Performed after integration testing and before deployment.
Importance:
Ensures that the complete software meets business and user requirements.
Tests overall system performance, security, and reliability.
Identifies end-to-end issues.

4. Acceptance Testing
Ensures the software meets business requirements and is ready for release.
Performed by end-users or stakeholders.
Often includes User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and Beta Testing.
Importance:
Confirms the software meets customer needs.
Identifies usability issues before deployment.
Reduces post-release defects and customer dissatisfaction.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Giving instructions to AI models to prompt an accurate and relevant response 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague: Write an essay?
Improved: Write an essay about the state of the nation address, include the following points which were par of the address, like Job employment opportunities to be created for the year 2025 and allocated Budget for the Information Technology bursaries
